# K-Means Cluster Analysis 

Clustering

## Project Objective:

The purpose of the first part of this project is to apply K-Means clustering to the dataset containing self-reported motivation scores for a class over five weeks. The patterns in motivation over this time were inspected and people were sorted into clusters based on these patterns.The visualization is shown below.

The purpose of the second part of this project is to cluster students in a graduate course in Data Mining based on their region and daily activities. Likewise, the third part of this project is to create a visualization that shows an overlap between these two analyses. The visualization is displayed below.
